# GIF Creation Script

This script is designed to create a GIF from a series of images. To ensure the script works correctly, you need to fill in the correct start and end numbers, as well as the directory where the images are located.

## Instructions

1. **Specify the Start and End Numbers:**
   - In the script, fill in the correct `start` and `end` numbers. These numbers should correspond to the sequence of images you want to include in the GIF.

2. **Set the Image Directory:**
   - Define the directory where the images are stored. Ensure the directory path is correctly specified in the script.

**NOTE**
   - The images in the directory must include the specified start and end numbers in their filenames for the script to correctly identify and use them in the GIF creation process.
