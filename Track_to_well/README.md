# Track to Well

## Overview
This documentation describes the two files generated by the "Track to Well" process: `track_to_well_unfiltered.csv` and `track_to_well_pp.csv`. These files contain information on tracked objects (tracks) and their association with specific wells.

## 1. `track_to_well_unfiltered.csv`
This file contains the raw, unfiltered tracking data before any duplicate checks are performed. It is possible for multiple wells to be associated with the same track in this file.

## 2. `track_to_well_pp.csv`
This file contains the post-processed tracking data after duplicate checks have been performed. In this file, each track ID appears only once, ensuring a unique association between tracks and wells.


## Output Files Format
**Columns:**
- **track_ID**: Unique identifier for each tracked object.
- **after_dispense_frame**: The frame number recorded by the Isolatric system after dispensing.
- **last_tracked_frame**: The frame number where the track was last detected.
- **last_tracked_tif**: The TIFF file corresponding to the last tracked frame.
- **row**: The row identifier of the well associated with the track.
- **col**: The column identifier of the well associated with the track.

This folder contains scripts designed to link the tracks generated by our tracker to the wells used to dispense the cells. The scripts ensure accurate mapping between the tracking data and the corresponding experimental wells.
