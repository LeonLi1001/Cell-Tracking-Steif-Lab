This repository contains various components and scripts used in different stages of our project, from tracking algorithms to feature extraction and image generation for the Isolatrix paper.

## Repository Structure

- **env/**
  - This folder contains the Conda environment used in this project. It includes all the dependencies and packages required to run the scripts and algorithms within this repository.

- **Tracker/**
  - This folder includes the tracking algorithm and the post-processing scripts that are ready for use. 

- **Track_to_well/**
  - The scripts in this folder are used to link the tracks generated by our tracker to the specific wells used in the experiment. 

- **Feature_extraction/**
  - This folder contains scripts for downstream analysis, specifically for extracting morphological features from the tracks generated by the Tracker. 

- **Isolatrix_figure/**
  - The Isolatrix folder holds all the scripts used to generate images for the Isolatrix paper. 

## Getting Started

1. **Set up the Environment:**
   - Use the environment files in the `env/` folder to recreate the Conda environment required to run the scripts. You can do this by navigating to the `env/` directory and using the command:
     ```bash
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     conda activate <your_env_name>
     ```

2. **Run Tracking Algorithms:**
   - Navigate to the `Tracker/` folder to run the tracking algorithms with post-processing. 

3. **Link Tracks to Wells:**
   - Use the scripts in `Track_to_well/` to associate the generated tracks with the corresponding experimental wells. 

4. **Feature Extraction:**
   - For downstream analysis, run the scripts in `Feature_extraction/` to extract morphological features from the tracked data. These features will be used in further analysis to derive insights from the experiments.

5. **Generate Isolatrix Figures:**
   - The `Isolatrix_figure/` folder contains a script that was used to generate the figures for the Isolatrix paper. Run the code block to produce the required visualizations.
