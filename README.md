# LELI

This repository contains various components and scripts used in different stages of our project, from tracking algorithms to feature extraction and image generation for the Isolatrix paper.

## Repository Structure

- **env/**
  - This folder contains the Conda environment used in this project. It includes all the dependencies and packages required to run the scripts and algorithms within this repository.

- **Tracker/**
  - This folder includes the tracking algorithm and the post-processing scripts that are ready for use. The tracking algorithm is designed to accurately track and analyze objects within the experimental data.

- **Track_to_well/**
  - The scripts in this folder are used to link the tracks generated by our tracker to the specific wells used in the experiment. This ensures that each track is correctly associated with its respective experimental condition.

- **Feature_extraction/**
  - This folder contains scripts for downstream analysis, specifically for extracting morphological features from the tracks generated by the Tracker. These features are crucial for subsequent data analysis and interpretation.

- **Isolatrix_figure/**
  - The Isolatrix folder holds all the scripts used to generate images for the Isolatrix paper. This includes figure generation and other visualizations that are part of the publication.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up the Environment:**
   - Use the environment files in the `env/` folder to recreate the Conda environment required to run the scripts. You can do this by navigating to the `env/` directory and using the command:
     ```bash
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     conda activate <your_env_name>
     ```

2. **Run Tracking Algorithms:**
   - Navigate to the `Tracker/` folder to run the tracking algorithms and the post-processing scripts. Ensure that the necessary input data is correctly formatted and placed in the appropriate directories.

3. **Link Tracks to Wells:**
   - Use the scripts in `Track_to_well/` to associate the generated tracks with the corresponding experimental wells. This step is essential for accurate data mapping.

4. **Feature Extraction:**
   - For downstream analysis, run the scripts in `Feature_extraction/` to extract morphological features from the tracked data. These features will be used in further analysis to derive insights from the experiments.

5. **Generate Isolatrix Figures:**
   - The `Isolatrix_figure/` folder contains all the necessary scripts to generate the figures for the Isolatrix paper. Follow the instructions in the scripts to produce the required visualizations.
